# Track Your Tasks 

**This is a very crude version of this application. Unusual behaviour may be observed and design is rather lazy. A much updated version is to be released soon!**
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

##[Task Tracker](https://sotonye0808.github.io/task-tracker)

This is a simple task tracker app built using React. It allows users to track their tasks by adding, deleting, and marking tasks as complete.

##Features
- Add new tasks: Users can add tasks by entering a task name and optionally specifying a day and time.
- Delete tasks: Users can remove tasks from the list.
- Toggle reminder: Users can toggle a reminder for a task, which will display a reminder notification.
- Responsive design: The app is responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Local storage: Task data is stored locally in the browser, so tasks persist even after refreshing the page.
